# Diabities-Pridection
The objective of this project is to predict whether a person is going to suffer from the diabetes with the given dataset.

•	Used Data Correlation matrix tools to understand the correlation between the different characteristics.

•	Graphical visualization of the data to have better understanding of the various feature values distribution.

•	Data cleaning and transformation is done to clean the data which have some of the missing values.

•	Splitting the dataset in two parts one for training dataset and other for test dataset.

•	Feature Scaling is required due to most of the MI algorithm doesn’t work well if the features have a different set of values.

•	Using model_selection utility comparing the multiple algorithm with the same dataset.

•	Used Boxplot to find the best Algorithm.

•	Trained the model and made the prediction based on the given data of a person.
